Predicting Apartment Prices in Mexico City üè†üí∞
Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and predictive model for apartment prices in Mexico City. The project covers data wrangling, visualization, model training, and evaluation to understand and predict real estate prices.

Motivation
Real estate prices in urban areas are influenced by various factors. This project aims to analyze these factors and build a predictive model that can estimate apartment prices in Mexico City. The insights gained can assist potential homebuyers, real estate agents, and investors in making informed decisions.

Data
data/mexico-city-real-estate-1.csv: First dataset for Mexico City.

data/mexico-city-real-estate-2.csv: Second dataset for Mexico City.

data/mexico-city-real-estate-3.csv: Third dataset for Mexico City.

data/mexico-city-real-estate-4.csv: Fourth dataset for Mexico City.

data/mexico-city-real-estate-5.csv: Fifth dataset for Mexico City.

data/mexico-city-test-features.csv: Test dataset for evaluating the model.

Visualizations

Analysis
The analysis was conducted using Python and includes:

Data Wrangling: Filtering, feature creation, and cleaning.

Data Visualization: Histograms and scatter plots to understand the data.

Descriptive Statistics: Summarizes key statistics for the datasets.

Predictive Modeling: Creating a Ridge Regression model to predict prices.

Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance and feature importances.

Conclusion
The analysis and modeling reveal significant insights into the factors influencing apartment prices in Mexico City. By eliminating outliers and focusing on key features, the predictive model achieved a mean absolute error of 14901.62.

Future Directions
Further research could explore:

More complex models for better accuracy.

The impact of socio-economic factors on apartment prices.

The influence of location-based features other than boroughs.
